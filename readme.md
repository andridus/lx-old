### Lx lang
 Lx Lang will compile all Elixir file (.ex) to BeamVM and the compiler to an executable file independent of Beam.
 It is developed with V Lang


### Goals
 - Fast compiler Elixir files to Beam VM
 - Compile Elixir File to native code (via V)


### To do List
 - [x] Lexing
 - [x] Parser file in AST Elixir structure
 - [x] Binary Expressions
 - [ ] Assignment Statement
 - [ ] Function Statement
 - [ ] Module Statement
 - [ ] Symbols table
 - [ ] Binary Erlang CodeGen
 - [ ] Binary Vlang CodeGen
 - [ ] Recreate compiler with Lx Lang
